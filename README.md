# AtliQ-Report-Using-Excel
The goal of this project is to deeply understand how the company is doing financially and where it stands in the market. I have created different reports like "Customer Net Sales Performance" and "Market Performance vs. Target" using basic and advanced Excel skills.
Project Details
In this project, I've developed a dynamic sales report using Excel pivot tables, offering businesses invaluable insights into customer discounts, negotiation strategies, and untapped markets. These reports provide actionable recommendations, empowering businesses to refine sales tactics, elevate customer experiences, and maximize revenue.

Throughout this journey, I've honed skills in:

1. Pivot tables
2. Power Query
3. Basic DAX functions
4. Effective Conditional Formatting
5. Report Presentation
6. Sales Domain Metrics

The primary goal is to arm businesses with the tools and insights needed to monitor, assess, and optimize their sales efforts. By leveraging data-driven analysis, businesses can uncover opportunities for growth, adapt to market changes, and maintain a competitive edge in an ever-evolving landscape.
